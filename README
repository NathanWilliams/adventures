I tend to bite off more then I can chew, and stop working on a project half way.
This is my attempt to change that.

The games here are simple and very short text adventure games.
My goal is to keep practicing and build up my confidence to take on bigger projects.

game1:
    v1: A simple connected rooms system, practiciing the basics
    v2: A reorganisation of v1 and some cleanup of the generated text

game2:
    A from scratch recreation of the room system, practice, practice, practice
